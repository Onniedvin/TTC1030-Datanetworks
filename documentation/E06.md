## Cables and devices
I will be using MikroTik's RouterBOARD hex-routers as my switches and routers. Cheapest I could find them is at 59,90€.

I will use copies of my laptop as the PCs/end hosts. Each costs 700€.

For cabling I need simple RJ-45 cables that are long enough. They are 9,90€ each.

## Machine housing
Good enough cabinets for switches and routers are pretty expensive. A good one I picked is 1224,90€.
