Student number: 2 1 0 9 3 3 2


Subnets: 10.09.93.0/24 AND 192.168.32.0/24


## Exercise 1
> What is the usable (host) address range of 192.168.32.0/24? What is the broadcast address? What is the subnet address?


```
11111111 . 11111111 . 11111111 . 00000000    -> BIN
nnnnnnnn . nnnnnnnn . nnnnnnnn . hhhhhhhh
255      . 255      . 255      . 0           -> DEC


Host bits:
|BIN             DEC|
|hhhh hhhh          |
|                   |
|0000 0000       0  |   Subnet address, all host bits are 0
|0000 0001       1  |
|0000 0010       2  |
|0000 0011       3  |
|0000 0100       4  |
|0000 0101       5  |
|0000 0110       6  |
|0000 0111       7  |
|0000 1000       8  |
|...                |
|1111 1100       252|
|1111 1101       253|
|1111 1110       254|
|1111 1111       255|   Broadcast address, all host bits are 1
```

Usable host address range = between 192.168.32.0 - 192.168.32.255, so 254 addresses for workstations


Broadcast address = 192.168.32.255


Subnet address = 192.168.32.0


## Exercise 2
> Divide the 192.168.ki.0/24 into smaller subnets with (atleast) 50 hosts in each. Notice! Make as small of a subnet/subnets as you can!

2^6 = 64, 64 is enough for 50 devices
